# AI Mini-Projects

A collection of early AI projects I worked on while learning computer vision, deep learning, and basic ML workflows.  
Each project has its own folder and full README.

## 🎯 Purpose  
This repository tracks small but meaningful projects I built while learning fundamentals of:
- Computer Vision  
- Image Segmentation  
- Deep Learning  
- Data Preprocessing  
- Model Training Pipelines  

Each folder includes full descriptions, code, and results.
